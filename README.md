# myhydraulics
you find here a optimized version of script given by prof arbaoui, on my machine 100 cycle take 11 sec.
you can change the N_Cyle variable to specific the number of iterations you want, in this script i use 100 
for speed up the script, i disable the ploting, if you want to plot uncomment the code.
also you find a array called Pmoy that compute the mean power used in each cycle.
and a array called Pmax that compute the max power used in each cycle.
if you want to get rid of window type "close all" and "clear all" to clean the workspace.
